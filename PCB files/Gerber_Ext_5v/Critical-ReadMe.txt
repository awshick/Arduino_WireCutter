If you have one of these boards made, please note there is an error in the 5V and 12V in silk screen. 
The '+' symbol, indicating power in, on both connectors is backwards.
So the connection point with the '+' symbol should be GND and not positive voltage.

The positive leads should be on the tops of the connectors, towards the ceramic capacitor. While the GND wires should be connected
on the bottom of the connectors, torwards the diode.
