# Arduino_WireCutter
Arduino wire cutter stripper with nextion display

I'm not a professional. I've worked on my own personal 3d printers for awhile so I'm familiar with arduino and steppers. Never have I done a project like this so its my first from start to finish. I basically saw Mr Innovatives video and wanted a machine similar, but no code or layout was provided. I've made some very simple 3d drawings for the supports and during my trial and error build I decided limit switches where the way I wanted to go. This way I dont care about steps when it comes to cutting the wire (other than feeding wire).
My first nextion HMI - lots of hardships getting through it and the arduino code, again I'm no pro by far. I'm sure there are alot of things that are questionable and/or not correctly done, but I went with what I could figure out.
Please feel free to contribute to the code, if you want to collabrate on this let me know and I'll open the door.
I can be contacted through garzajd3@yahoo.com or message on github.
