My setup uses : with_limit_switch.ino

If using Mr.Innovative's MultiPurposePCBv2 , will want to use arduino file in 'MultiPuposePCBv2' folder.
**this setup does NOT use limit switches, can be added but it is not in the code.

If not using limit switches and Mr.Innovatives pcb board then use arduino file in 'no_limit_switch' folder.
Fair warning, I have not tested this - and pretty sure its not ready for use as-is. Code needs cleaning for 
limit switch removal.
