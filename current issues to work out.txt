If arduino update / change is needed must unplug nextion display.
I'm guessing the nextion is sending replies when usb data is being uploaded causing error.

manually setting how many steps are needed to create a "strip" cut vs wire cut.
This seems to be not exact as some cuts are cleaner than others.

On power on stepper for cutter is jittering around for a few seconds. Suspected power draw, but with 2nd 5vdc input issue remains.
Will continue to look for solution.
