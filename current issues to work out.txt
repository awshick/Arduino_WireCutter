If arduino update / change is needed must unplug nextion display.
I'm guessing the nextion is sending replies when usb data is being uploaded causing error.

manually setting how many steps are needed to create a "strip" cut vs wire cut.
This seems to be not exact as some cuts are cleaner than others.

Also now I'm getting some binding when wire is being cut. Not enough torque on stepper to always cut
withough skipping step(s). Since the limit switch isnt hit it keeps going and after a few skips it makes
the cut. May try a geared servo just for more reliable / repeatable use.
