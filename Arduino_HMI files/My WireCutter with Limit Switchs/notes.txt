8/1/22:
Modified arduino code to adjust length value. Was set to an integer, so if you entered 10.5 it was taking the whole number only (10).
Changed all associated values to float. As the entry is broken into steps (not distance) it will still be a whole number (rounded) for
the loop portion. This should be a closer match to the input length, but still will not be exact.
