This is a custom layout I did for this setup.
Nothing special, and can be done on breadboard or with just wire(s).
I'm still waiting to recieve PCB to verify I did not miss something.
I also added a 5vdc input, as in my testing the LM7805's looked to power everything
without issue, but nothing actually worked unless arduino was plugged in. I suspect
low current, even with 2 in parallel, but may be a ground/pwr issue on my layout.

Will look into this once board(s) are recieved.
