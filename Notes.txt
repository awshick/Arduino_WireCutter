10/24/2021:
I've made a few modifications, mostly cosmetic. I've mounted everything on a plastic box, and housed the electronics within it.
I've recieve no contact, so not sure anyone is even following this. If you are reading this and want to make one - reach out to me and I'll give you all the help I can.
If you've emailed me and no response, may have gone to spam. Try me at garzajd3@gmail.com (I check this frequently).


This is for 2 stepper setup only. No servo used, as wire is feed into strip point of strippers, and if to be cut stripper is simply fully closed.
Input voltage is 12vDC, not sure of max current draw but I have an 8.5A power supply (way overkill just using what I had on hand).
I did alot of my inital testing with a 12vdc 2amp power brick and it seemed to work just fine.

I used servos in 1/2 step mode, so MS1,MS2,MS3 are needed.
If you want to use in full step, then MS1-MS3 are not required and arduino code will need to be modified
to remove mode selection.
Also if you do not want to use limit switches, code will need to be adjusted for actual steps required.

Videos I used to help me with this:
Nextion Display (Huge thanks to Cheap Controls channel. Tons of Nextion stuff here!!!):

Where this version of the ideal came of,atleast for me (Mr Innovative channel):

Dumb things that took me way to long to figure out:

Using Nextion Editor for HMI programming/layout (https://nextion.tech/nextion-editor/)
I made my own keyboard input, because I could not figure out how to use the built-in one until I was already done.
By then I was not going to go back and update everything.

If using a different Nextion display change this by opening the WireCutter_v5.HMI file in nextion editor
On the top ICON line (after Redo) select the 'Deivce' button to change model/orientation.

The Arduino code may not be as efficient or clean as it should, but I'm not a professional so it just needs to work
reliably. Feel free to improve on.
