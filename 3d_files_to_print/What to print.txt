Parts I drew/printed and used:
cutter_holder v1.stl		Holds wire stripper in place. Also used to mark drill points on cutter for screw retention.
Nema17_Mount v1.stl		90 degree mount for nema 17 stepper (cut motor)
Cut_Link v2.stl			adjustable link from cutter to motor spin
partA.stl			Cutter stepper spindle attachment.
Dispaly_Stand v1.stl		45 degree flat stand for display, may need trimming for good fit.
Display_Bezel v2.stl		bezel to go on outside of display. I currently just glue this in a few spots so it can be removed if needed.
Feed_Stand.stl			Feed stepper stand. Used so I dont need to bolt stepper directly to surface.
wire_guide_BOT v3.stl 		adjustable to hold boden tube from feed stepper to cutter
wire_guide_TOP v3.stl		2nd portion of above item.
StopSwitchDual v1.stl		Used to mount both stop switch(s) to motor.


files under extruder folder are for the feed motor wire feed. A small bearing will be needed.
I've used something like this instead:

If link is broken, google "ender 3 extruder". Cheaper plastic versions or aluminum should work just fine.
The gear will leave tiny teeth impressions in wire, but I've had no issues with wire. Have not found a suitable rubber variant yet.
